//The n-queens problem is amenable to encoding into SAT. Your task is to write a program that takes an integer n as input and finds a solution to the n-queens problem by encoding it into SAT.
// Program input: An integer n > 0 entered as a command line argument to your binary or script.
// Program output: A solution to the n-queens problem. (Note that I am looking for one solution and not all of them.) The output should be in the following format (example given for n = 4):

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	// Process input
	if (argc != 2)
	{
		printf("usage: nQueenSAT [number of queens ðŸ’…]\n");
	}

	// Convert input into minisat input

	// Write input file

	// Solve with minisat

	// Read minisat output

	// Output result to command line
	

	return 0;
}
